We were talking about this earlier, but North Korea is an interesting case, because we can’t usually bring North Koreans or their laundering co-conspirators to justice in the US because they’re mostly in North Korea. Or they’re in jurisdictions where we can’t extradite them. So we can’t do the usual, we’re going to indict, have a complaint against someone, and then bring them here so that they can be brought to trial. Instead, we need to think about more creative ways in order to get at the ultimate issue here, which is that they’re generating revenue for their WMD and ballistic missile programs. So I’m sorry, I’m going to keep talking about Zia Farooqi. He is the mastermind behind freezing, seizing, and forfeiting assets to try and make victims whole. 

**Christopher:** 
He is. 

**Jessica:** 
It is a lengthy process, but like Chris was saying, with blockchain it’s much easier to follow the money and try to do that as quickly as possible in each of these cases. 

**Ian:** 
Talk more about the process of freezing and seizing. What does that actually entail? North Korea steals some crypto from somebody, then what happens? 

**Jessica:** 
Do you want to talk about how the FBI, IRS, and others find out about these hacks first, and then we can go into freezing and seizing? 

**Christopher:** 
Sure, we can do that. Give you the question list. 

**Ian:** 
I think I have a co-host this episode. 

**Christopher:** 
Yeah, I was just going to say that. She does it to me all the time. I mean maybe it’s new for you. 

**Ian:** 
Yeah. Chris, why don’t you take us through, so someone’s been hacked, they’ve lost tens, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars. How do they get in touch with you? 

**Christopher:** 
There’s a number of ways this could potentially happen. A lot of times we’ll have the victims themselves reach out. And at this stage I would say in our careers, we know a lot of people in the industry and a lot of people know other people. So sometimes we’ll just get that direct communication from the victim saying, “Hey, we have a problem. We lost assets.” Or they might be the client of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] knows who we are, and they might contact us if they have or they suspect who did it. 

In other instances where the victim doesn’t come to anybody, but if the theft is large scale enough, the way crypto operates these days, there are companies out there that will notice that there’s tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars leaving some exchanges hot. While if that doesn’t look normal and it gets blasted out on crypto Twitter, sometimes that’s the source of your first realization that an event has occurred. 

**Ian:** 
Okay, so you got a call or a referral from a friend of a friend who says, “Unfortunately all my crypto has been stolen.” 

**Christopher:** 
Yeah. 

**Ian:** 
What’s the first thing you do when you get that call? 

**Christopher:** 
Generally speaking, one of the first things that we will do, and maybe it’s good to peel it back a little bit, there are probably two ways you can look at these cases as they come through. One is like we talked about attribution, who did it? 

**Ian:** 
Yeah. 

**Christopher:** 
And then two is follow the money. 

**Ian:** 
Right. 

**Christopher:** 
Historically with other cases you might say, “Well, I need to focus on forensic artifacts. I need to focus on getting this item, this data, that could be temporary transitory in nature. I need to make sure I get that, and I have to talk to the victim.” But in the crypto case, because crypto can move so fast, cross-border transfers, swaps, all of these things that are going to make our life much, much more difficult the longer, we let this go; a lot of the times it’s like follow the money and follow it immediately, and look for those opportunities to interdict. So we find that we’re most successful within the first 24 hours of learning of an event to be able to identify putting those addresses in whatever tool we choose to use, identifying where there’s assets, where we can interdict, are there essentially managed stable coins that are stolen and at issue that haven’t been swapped to something else? Are the assets going through a provider or a VASP, a virtual asset service provider, that we have a relationship with that is responsive? 

So those are some of the first things that we’re going to do; in essence triage. What can we do now? 

**Ian:** 
Yeah. 

**Jessica:** 
That’s Chris’ pitch for people reaching out as soon as possible, when they’re the victims. 

**Christopher:** 
That’s right. 

**Ian:** 
I mean, if there’s one takeaway for people listening, if you ever find yourself in this situation, don’t sleep on it. Immediately get in contact. The faster you do, the better the chance that there’s some recovery at the other side, right? 

**Christopher:** 
Sure. I think back to some of the thefts that I saw previously. If you think back to, I don’t know, 2018, a lot of the times the way the crypto exchanges were handling theft is that they didn’t really want to talk about it. 

**Ian:** 
Right. 

**Christopher:** 
They didn’t want to let out how much was lost, where it went, all these things. But at some point in time, I think those exchanges potentially started to realize that maybe it’s better if they were really, really public about this. 

**Ian:** 
Yeah. 

**Christopher:** 
Because now those assets are tainted in a sense. When people are looking in React or whatever other tool, maybe their mark is stolen. But unless people are aware of it and it’s public about it, they don’t know. So if you look at, I think when the KuCoin theft happened in 2020, they had a whole webpage up, all the addresses that were up there. And as an investigator, that’s great, because if KuCoin doesn’t talk to me, I can still plop all those addresses in whatever tool I’m using and follow the money. 

**Ian:** 
Yeah, absolutely. 

**Christopher:** 
It’s one of these weird things with blockchain, the public nature of it, it changes the game. If it was a bank robbery… 

**Ian:** 
Yeah. 

**Jessica:** 
Much harder to follow. 

**Christopher:** 
Yeah. 

**Ian:** 
Definitely. So Jessica, back to you. So now Chris and the team, a victim has come to them, reported stolen funds. They’ve been able to trace some of the funds, potentially gotten in touch with an exchange where they’re holding the funds. Is that the point at which you get involved, in terms of the… 

**Jessica:** 
I’m usually involved from the very beginning. 

**Ian:** 
Well, even better. 

**Christopher:** 
I try to keep her involved and up to date. 

**Jessica:** 
It makes things easier in the long run. 

**Christopher:** 
Yeah. 

**Jessica:** 
So at that point, we’re making sure that we have probable cause to believe that the proceeds are proceeds of a crime, so they’re criminal proceeds. And at that point we make a voluntary request of the exchange in the U.S. or in exchange abroad potentially, that they please voluntarily get a freeze in place while we work toward getting a seizure warrant, which is a court-authorized document that will tell them you need to transfer these assets to government control. 

Now there’s a lot of nuance there because, like Chris was saying, everything is so cross-border in nature. So if you had a case where a U.S.-based exchange is involved, it’s amazing for us. We send them a quick note, we get a warrant very quickly, we send it over and they have to comply. And they have top cover for having frozen and then transferred someone’s funds to us, because they have a warrant in their hand. 

When we’re talking about exchanges and other platforms that are outside of the United States, it gets way more complicated. Some of these entities are in four different locations or they don’t say where they’re located. So we’re still asking for a voluntary freeze, maybe not knowing exactly where they’re located yet. We’re just trying to find them as quickly as possible. So there’s a lot of back and forth in this industry, and I feel like we’re still in these stages of figuring out how to get people all moving at the same speed, so that we can freeze and seize and stop criminal actors from using the space at all. I think that’s where we’re all trying to go. 

But there are some jurisdictions where we need to go through the mutual legal assistance process, for example. So we might have initial outreach with an exchange based abroad; they’re willing to do a voluntary freeze, and then we get our seizure warrant transmitted to them via the mutual legal assistance process. That is a very time-consuming process in most instances. You’re going through the central authorities for both countries, and then eventually they’ll transfer the asset. That can take anywhere from three months to five years. So if that’s what we have, that’s what we have, and that’s the legal process we need to go through. 

But there’s other circumstances where companies in the industry are willing to move money on a voluntary basis to get it back
